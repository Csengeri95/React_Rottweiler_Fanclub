# React App

This is a rottweiler fanclub website made by me, using React framework and SCSS preprocessor. On the main page, the visitor will find an introduction text, along with a Carousel, images below which can be clicked to display the characteristics of the breed. The second page is the Introduction of the breed. Here you can read a whole page about the history, breeding, appearance, character and care of the breed. The third page is the Events page, where I display news about the fanclub and the breed (these can be sorted by date) like a message board. The last page is the Contacts page.
